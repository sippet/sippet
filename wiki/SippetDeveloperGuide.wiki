#summary The general sippet Developer Guide

= Introduction =

Sippet enables you to design applications that manages real-time media sessions using SIP. The source code contains sample applications, all using [https://code.google.com/p/gyp/ GYP]. The code may have some external dependencies (for instance, the C++ Standard Libraries and other development libraries and headers, depending on your platform). By the way they are kept at a minimum, and they are indicated in the code and in the build instructions.

The code includes network and proxy negotiation classes, SIP message parsing classes, and all the code required to initiate connections and exchange data between two computers. By the way, it doesn't offer handling of SDP messages, as it's normally performed by outlying multimedia libraries (like WebRTC PeerConnection). The network layer code enables applications to robustly traverse SIP over NAT and firewall devices using proxies and SOCKS. You can use the code as provided, or extend it to fit your specific needs, according to the Berkeley-style [https://developers.google.com/talk/libjingle/license license].


= Prerequisites =

In order to use sippet, you should be familiar with the SIP protocol (starting by [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt RFC 3261]), general networking concepts, and C++. Additionally, it helps to be familiar with the [http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/simple/charter/ SIMPLE extensions].

The requirements to build and use sippet are given in [CreatingSippetApplication Creating a Sippet Application].
