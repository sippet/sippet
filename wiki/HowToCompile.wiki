#summary How to compile

= Build instructions =

Follow the same instructions given in Chromium documentation: [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows Windows], [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/MacBuildInstructions Mac OS X], [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxBuildInstructions Linux], [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/AndroidBuildInstructions Android], and [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-ios iOS]


= Building Sippet =

== Install depot_tools ==

Follow the documentation from Chromium build:
http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools.


= Checkout the sources =

== Windows ==

Create a directory to hold your source code. This example assumes c:\chromium_sippet, but other names are fine.

*Important:* Make sure the full directory path has no spaces.

In a shell window, execute the following commands:

<code language="xml">
cd c:\chromium_sippet
gclient config http://sippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
</code>

To download the initial code, update your checkout as described in next section.

== Linux ==

Pick a directory for your build.  We will call this directory $CHROMIUM_SIPPET_ROOT below.

Check out the code:

<code language="xml">
$ cd $CHROMIUM_SIPPET_ROOT
$ gclient config http://sippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
</code>

To download the initial code, update your checkout as described in next
section.

== Mac OSX ==

Create a directory to hold the code.  This example assumes the directory is ~/chromium_sippet, but other names are fine.  Note that if you have FileVault enabled, you'll want to either disable it or put the code in a folder outside the home directory, as otherwise Xcode will be very slow or hang.  You also probably want to disable Spotlight indexing for that folder (System Preferences -> Spotlight -> mark the folder as private).

From a shell in the Terminal, execute the following commands: 

<code language="xml">
$ cd ~/chromium_sippet
$ gclient config http://sippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
</code>

To download the initial code, update your checkout as described in next section.


= Update to the latest revision =

The first time you execute gclient, there will be a delay (a minute or so) while it updates the depot tools.

In a shell window, execute the following commands:

<code language="xml">
cd chromium_sippet
gclient sync
</code>

To update to a specific revision, use

<code language="xml">
gclient sync --revision trunk@####
</code>

and the DEPS file will make sure you get the other directories in their
matching forms.


= Create the build using GYP =

The build is created using gclient 'runhooks' command:

<code language="xml">
cd chromium_sippet/trunk
gclient runhooks
</code>

Now that you have the build set up, just start compiling. Ninja is now the official Chromium build tool for all platforms, so, you would just do:

<code language="xml">
ninja -C out/Debug sippet
</code>

== Building in Visual Studio ==

According to [http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows Official Chrome Build Instructions], you have to do the following in order to generate a VS2013 solution:

<code language="xml">
set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2013
set DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0
set GYP_GENERATORS=msvs
gclient runhooks
</code>

Now just open VS and point it to the solution recently created by GYP in `chromium_sippet/trunk/sippet/all.sln`.
