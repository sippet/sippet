---------------------------------------

Under patent law, it is a legitimate use to study or experiment with a patented
technology without paying for a patent license. You only have to pay royalty
fees if you sell a product based on the technology or use the technology in
products internally (this includes using the codec in a commercial setting,
even if you aren't selling your platform, but only a service).
