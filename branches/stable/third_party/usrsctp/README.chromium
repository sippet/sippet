   draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpcsum-05.txt
   draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpimpguide-05.txt
   draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-04.txt

   draft-iyengar-sctp-cacc-00.txt

Local Modifications:
usrsctplib provides its own SHA1 implementations as part of the library. Since
chrome already has the support of both NSS and OPENSSL which already
implementats SHA1, Chromium will not include the SHA1 from usrsctplib.

Overrides folder has the necessary changes to strip the existing SHA1
implementation in usrsctplib and use OPENSSL or NSS implementation based on the
platform type.

To re-create the patch file run:
diff -PcrB usrsctplib overrides/usrsctplib > localchanges.patch
