Description:
This is PJSIP, the a free and open source multimedia communication library,
which is used *only* in the following cases:

 - For Sippet/EmbeddedTestServer, only on Desktop platforms (Windows, Mac OSX
   and Linux), to implement a testing SIP server.

   There's no plans to use PJSIP inside sippet.

This means that the library must be built for these systems:

  Linux/x86
  Linux/x86_64
  Darwin/x86
  Darwin/x86_64
  Windows/x86
  Windows/x86_64

Whenever you change it, try to rebuild Sippet for all these systems.
